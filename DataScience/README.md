# How to Build a Data Science Project

For this essay on approaching a Data Science or Machine Learning solution, let's consider a generic practical problem. Imagine we are a streaming company seeking to recommend YouTube videos to our users. The application should suggest the videos based on a pre-calculated rating. The higher the video rating, the more it should be recommended to our users.


## What is the Business Problem?
Users are spending a lot of time searching for new videos on YouTube.

## What is the expected solution?
Users should have recommendations or a list containing only their favourite videos.

## How do I solve this with Data Science/ML?
To address the problem, creating a video recommendation solution would be necessary.

## What should be the final state of the solution (production)?
- First approach: A system based on a "cut-off point" -> Example: return only the Top 5
- Second approach: A ranking system -> Sort the highest-rated videos
- A web application: With the videos (links) and the sorted predictions.

## How do we measure the quality of the proposed solution?
- Primary metric: How many do I add to the Watch Later list from the top N videos?
- Secondary metric(s): How much time do I spend selecting videos?

## How do you identify if the solution solves the company's problem?
Increase in financial returns. Automation of manual tasks. Reduction in working time. Cost reduction.

## How do you select a problem to work?

- Simple problems:

    - Recommendation (sales increase, marketing)
    - Time Series (sales forecasting)

- What is your interest?
  - Select a project that you liked.

- How to find Datasets?
  - Kaggle, Web scraping, Public sources

- Create an information list.
  - Collect information about the selected project or dataset.

- What is the minimum dataset needed?
  - What variables do I need, with what labels?
